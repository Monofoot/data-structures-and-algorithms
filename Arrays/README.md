An array is a group of items with corresponding index locations and 
memory addresses. The example below is the string "ROB" - at the bottom is 
the (imaginary) memory location and the top is the index (and 
remember, computers are special so we start at 0).

| R | O | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 200 | 201 | 202 |

So, index 2 is the letter "B", which has the memory address 202.
